# StockSpider

**Notice: This project is no longer maintained, please take a step to [pyspider-stock][1]**

this is a basic StockSpider for data mining

first commit: ShenZhouXinXi GuYouHui 1

second commit: ShenZhouXinXi GuYouHui 1~n

third commit: can scrape all the tiezi in stock's GuYouHui 

fourth commit: can save data in the different database in MongoDB

bugs to be fixed: when clear the redis cache and run the program again,the data in the MongoDB would repeat.That's what I need to be done in the next few days.

still need to be done: 1.optimize all stocks scrape  2.real time scrape
